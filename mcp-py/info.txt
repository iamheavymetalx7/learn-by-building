# Overview

This project provides an implementation of a weather forecasting and alert system using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It includes both client and server components, as well as an alternative implementation without MCP.

## Key Components

1. **Client**  
   - Contains methods for invoking the LLM (Large Language Model) and managing conversation parameters.  
   - Acts as the interface for sending queries to the server.

2. **Server**  
   - Provides an API to fetch weather forecasts or alerts.  
   - Accepts a two-letter state symbol (e.g., "CA" for California) in the USA to return weather information based on the user's request.

3. **Groq Folder**  
   - Contains the same implementation as above but without using MCP.

## How to Get Started

1. Refer to the [Quickstart Resources](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/tree/main) for the original implementation details.  
2. To run the server and pass queries via the client, follow the instructions provided in the `instructions.txt` file located inside the `mcp-client` folder.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the project.
